            <p>For studio 4, I wanted to create a glimpse into my iPhone alarms that wake me up in the morning. If I had more time, I would've included more alarms about the more interesting aspects of my day. For this page, the user clicks or hovers on an alarm to reveal why I set that alarm. I wanted to create the interface to feel as if they are using the alarm application on my iPhone. I originally wanted the alarm ringtone to start playing when the user clicks on an alarm, but decided to have it play only once when the page loads.</p>

            <p>A web-based form that I used often is <a href="https://www.typeform.com/">typeform.</a></p><p>Forms are generally simple, boring, and to the point. It requires constant tapping of the tab key to get to the next field, and it is a monotonous task. Typeform makes filling out a form interesting and aesthetically pleasing. The interface is modern and easy to use. It shows you one field at a time, and goes on to the next field by easily pressing "enter". It allows the user to put less effort in, and makes it less yawn-inducing. I enjoy filling out forms because Typeform makes it fun, and something nice to look at. </p>

            <p>A user interface that I use quite often is pretty well-known: Tumblr.com. I use Tumblr to pass the time, gather ideas on aesthetics, and blog out my emotions. Ever since I started using Tumblr in middle school, I’ve navigated the website with ease. Tumblr features endless scrolling and a like / reblog button; these features encompass a fairly simple interface. Though it has changed over the years, the interface has become even more friendly. A large “toolbar” sits at the top of the page, allowing the user to easily create a new text post, or post a photo, quote, video, etc. Much of what you can do on Tumblr is available to you on your account’s dashboard. This creates a more personable interface -- it feels like your own online journal complete with a carefully chosen feed and unique posts. The visual design of Tumblr displays the familiar flat design and iconic “Tumblr blue”. Icons, slight variations of the “Tumblr blue”, and sans-serif fonts create a simple yet still modern web design. All these characteristics tie together to create an aesthetic and time consuming user interface that has lasted through the ages.</p>
