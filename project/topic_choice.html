            <h2>calligraphy app</h2>
            <p>an application that allows you to write and practice other languages' calligraphy (or hand lettering). applications like this already exist, but i thought making it more of a combined learning and interactive experience with more than one language to practice. also, since hand lettering and calligraphy have become so popular, it could kill two birds with one stone.</p>
